                    <p>Here are some tips that will help you care for indoor plants:<br>
                    <br>
                    -Keep potting soil moist- It’s important to make sure soil is not too wet nor too dry.<br>
                    <br>
                    -Make sure the plant pot has drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.<br>
                    <br>
                    -Place your plant near a light source, whether it’s natural or artificial.</p>

                    <h>Repotting</h>
                    <p>Unless your indoor plant has become too large for the pot it is in, you typically don’t need to re-pot indoor plants.</p>

                    <h>Watering</h>
                    <p>Over-watering is a common mistake, and you will want to make sure the plant actually requires water now or if it should wait until later.</p>

                    <h>Research</h>
                    <p>Do your research before buying a plant! It's as simple as that. Knowing the kind of plant and the expected conditions it should be living in will drastically improve the lifespan of it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Just because a plant is large and sold for a low price does not mean you are getting the best deal. Doing some research prior to buying or speaking with a salesperson at a gardening center will help you out in the long run.
